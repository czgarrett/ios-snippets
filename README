This project basically is just a repository for commonly needed copy/paste code, such as delegate methods and idioms such as block declarations.  

In general I am wary of copy/paste programming, so anything that should be put into a category or reusable library will go elsewhere.  (A new github project that does this will be coming.)

Guidelines for snippets:

How to use it:

Point your favorite text editor toward the root of the repo, and keep it open while you use XCode.  Please feel free to send your own snippets and I will add them.
