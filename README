This project basically is just a repository for commonly needed copy/paste code, such as delegate methods and idioms such as block declarations.  

In general I am wary of copy/paste programming, so anything is really reusable should be put into a category or reusable library will go elsewhere.  (A new github project that does this will be coming.)

Guidelines for snippets:

Snippets are NOT intended to be code that is reusable, but rather templates of common idioms.

Each file is usable by copying all of its contents.  This enables the fastest use of it:  switch to text editor, Select All, back to XCode to paste.

How to use it:

Point your favorite text editor toward the root of the repo, and keep it open while you use XCode.  Please feel free to send your own snippets and I will add them.
